//There is one section that says you dont have to understand
//When we call methods or functions in C++ and pass values to them, we give them a copy of the value, not the actual value
//Functions get a copy of variables and are allowed to change them for their scope
//Don't pass the value, instead tell me where the value is and let me change it. This is allowed by using the * or & character

//Line 50, the & symbol in &category states that it will actually modify the value.

//The program will read each line from the file until the line is empty

//void means nothing. It means I am not gonna return anything from this method.
//print methods don't return anything so we classify them as void. void means you are not getting a value out of it.

//double means double precision, it's like a better float

//THere is two ways to use exclamation marks in C++. If it is in front of something, it means NOT.
//If you see the exclamation after an = sign, it means NOT equal

//To get the data into the program, we can either copy paste from each file or use the terminal
//Do: ./grade_calculator < test_exam_1.txt 

//const means the value in this function will not change.

//Mimir will allow you to submit every 5 minutes. You can do this as many times as you want until you get a 100.
